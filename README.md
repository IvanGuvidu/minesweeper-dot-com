## Introduction

Arcade-Games.com is a web application that offers a variety of classic arcade games for users to play online. The platform is designed to provide an engaging and nostalgic gaming experience, featuring popular titles such as Minesweeper, Snake and Tic-Tac-Toe.

## Features

### 1. User Authentication

* Users can create accounts, log in, and manage their profiles.

### 2. Game Selection

Here at Arcade-Games.com, users can choose from a variety of classic arcade games, including Minesweeper, Snake, and Tic-Tac-Toe. Each game is designed to provide an engaging and nostalgic gaming experience.

**Our games**

1. Minesweeper

* A classic puzzle game where players uncover squares on a grid while avoiding hidden mines.
* Each game starts with a 10x10 grid containing 15 hidden mines.
* Players can flag suspected mines and reveal safe squares to clear the board.
* If stuck, players can request a hint generated by a Probabilistic Model to help identify safe squares.

2. Tic-Tac-Toe

* A simple two-player game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid.
* The first player to align three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.
* If all spaces are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

3. Snake

* A classic arcade game where players control a snake that grows longer as it eats food.
* The objective is to navigate the snake around the screen without colliding with walls or itself.
* Players can use arrow keys to control the snake's direction and aim for the highest score possible.

### 3. Backend Functionality

The backend of Arcade-Games.com is built using Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python. The application handles user authentication, game state management, and real-time updates to ensure a smooth gaming experience.

## Technologies Used

* Frontend:
    * HTML, CSS for structure and styling
    * JavaScript for interactivity

* Backend:
    * Python with Flask for server-side logic, routing, and game state management
    * Session management for user authentication and game progress tracking

* Deployment:
    * Docker for containerization and easy deployment across different environments

## Instructions

Before following the steps below, make sure you have **port 5000 available** on your machine!!

To run the Arcade-Games.com application locally, follow these steps:

1. In the project root directory, build the Docker image:

   ```bash
   docker build -t arcade-games .
   ```

2. Run the Docker container:

   ```bash
    docker run -d -p 5000:5000 arcade-games
    ```

3. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to access the application.

If you wish to stop the application, you can stop the Docker container using the following command:

```bash
docker ps  # Find the container ID
docker stop <container_id>
```

## Workload

* Andrei-Cristian Ivan: Backend Development of Minesweeper game logic (including the probabilistic model for hints), User Authentication, Session Management and Deployment.
* Alexandru Peticaru: Main Frontend Development, Backend development of Tic-Tac-Toe and Snake game logic.

## Difficulties

During the development of Arcade-Games.com, we encountered several challenges:

* It was our first time working with Flask, which required us to learn the framework and its best practices.
* For the Minesweeper game, we actually tried to research multiple algorithms for board generation and hint systems, which took a significant amount of time to implement and test.
* It was very interesting to see how we would integrate the movement controls for the Snake in an interactive web page.
* Nobody had any prior experience with Frontend, so going from a very simple HTML page to a more complex and interactive design was a steep learning curve.
* Since `routes.py` was getting quite large, we accidentally managed to create some merge conflicts that we had to resolve carefully.

## Conclusions

Arcade-Games.com has been a rewarding project that allowed us to explore web development using Flask and enhance our skills in both frontend and backend technologies. Through this experience, we have gained valuable insights into user authentication, game logic implementation, and session management.

We learned a lot about teamwork and collaboration, especially when dealing with merge conflicts and integrating different components of the application. Overall, this project has been a significant step in our journey as developers, and we look forward to building more complex applications in the future.
